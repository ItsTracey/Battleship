# Battleship
This is a simple text-based Battleship game written in Python. It's a great beginner project that demonstrates the use of lists, loops, conditionals, and user input.


# How It Works
A 5x5 game board is generated.
A single battleship is hidden at a random location.
The player has 4 turns to guess the correct row and column.
If the player guesses correctly, they win.
If the player guesses wrong, an "X" marks the spot and they try again.
If the guess is outside the board or has already been guessed, the game notifies the player.


# Key Features
Randomized ship placement
Turn-based gameplay
Input validation
Simple 2D list manipulation


# How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, simply run the script using the terminal or any Python IDE:
python battleship.py


# Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)
Allow multiple ships on the board
Add difficulty levels (more turns, larger board)
Create a GUI version using tkinter
Add a 2-player mode
